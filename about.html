            <p>Our design philosophy is informed by the 
                existing architecture of the spaces we work with,
                but we use thot as a jumping-off point for more
                progressive design ideas.

            <p>
                When we accept a commission,our goal is to 
                understand both what our client wants,and
                what our client needs.Working with us about
                entering into a conversation about what you 
                want your space to be.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have extensive experience in and understanding 
                of all aspects of design, from the use of light
                and space,to the feel of eaw marbie under
                bare feet.
